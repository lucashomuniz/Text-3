# Lens Technology: Big Data & Building Information Modeling

The construction industry is responsible for carrying out some of the largest and most expensive projects on the planet. Huge amounts of resources and work are devoted to large construction projects, generating large volumes of data.It’s an industry where nearly a third of costs are accounted for material waste and rework. So figuring out the cost of each bolt can be the difference between staying on budget and bankrupting an organization that finances a construction project. Normally, this market demands a complex process to result in the construction of an building. It’s need access to 2D and 3D data, financial data, corporate data, documents, timeline elements and weather information, all of which have to be fully connected and accessible. In this sense, based on a partnership between entrepreneurs in the field of international Civil Construction and the engineering software company Autodesk, a functionality for viewing large models was linked to its own estimation system, with the aim of developing a technology that allows real-time data-driven predictive modeling known as LENS.

In summary, LENS is a combination of Big Data and Building Information Modeling. It is a very complex but very interesting application of Data Science in Civil Engineering. It is a platform that allows modeling and simulations based on historical construction data, allowing changes to be made with greater awareness of the possible consequences and without major scares. The objective of the system is to be a more efficient tool for planning constructions, making global management and decision-making more effective.
The BIM platform is already influenced by the development and improvement of equipment associated with the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, 3D Printing of Buildings and more currently by the application of LENS technology. Building Information Modeling, unlike what many think, is not just software that must be installed on a machine to create construction projects. In fact, it is a methodology that, throughout the life cycle of a project, allows the management of 3D modeling information and generates information to guide decisions in all disciplines involved. Based on the assumptions of the LENS technology, the owner of a development which is financing the construction, can have access to a conceptual model and visualize the financial parameters associated with it. It becomes possible to analyze several possibilities, such as the construction of more or less floors, increase or decrease a certain built area and compare the use of different construction methods in a locality.

Each design element becomes linked to the overall project cost estimate and is completely integrated so the solution changes visually, in real time. In this way, the dimensioning process is enormously accelerated and even in the initial stages, it contributes to the reduction of waste. Before using this technology, small design changes could mean several weeks or months of communications between architects, engineers and owners, insights into the effects of changes are now visible almost instantly.
Sequentially, it is necessary to implement the creation of Distributed Storage Cloud Systems, in order to place all data within reach of anyone who needs them. This system means that data can be added almost infinitely, as fast as it can be collected, at minimal cost. In this way, Project Engineers can quickly gain an overview of quality control, safety, and productivity data. Problems can be identified before they arise, leading to huge time and cost savings. External data also plays an important role, for example weather reports. Weather conditions can delay construction projects, which inevitably leads to increased expenses. When you develop a record of climate effects, you can use this data to model likely project implications, resulting in more accurate assessments and planning. For larger projects, which tend to take several years to complete, economic and political activity is likely to affect labor and material costs, so this can also be taken into account.

Historically, the term Big Data is directly related to the large amount of data that is generated quickly, coming from sources such as audio, video, social media content, images, among others. Due to the large volume, variety, speed of data, knowing its veracity is essential for organizations, since the quality of available information can impact decision-making. Some construction companies have achieved significant results in terms of reducing waste when using LENS technology. Similarly, there is an improvement in productivity and cost reduction, due to advanced simulations that help reduce the amount of changes and adjustments required in engineering projects. Finally, it becomes impossible to implement LENS technology without associating it with the assumptions of BIM and Big Data. At the same time, it is not possible to implement Building Information Modeling without integration between civil construction disciplines, such as architecture, structure, facilities, schedule, budget, contracts, sustainability, maintenance and safety. As a result, the most important task for a construction company is to manage information, establishing a centralized database that is integrated with other information systems, respecting standards, libraries and norms to be used throughout the project’s life cycle.
